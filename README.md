MorbidMotivation
================
Chrome extension that replaces the new tab page with a countdown to projected time of death in seconds, inspired by the "Motivation" extension.

Built with standard html, javascript, and css. No JS libraries are used. Portions of purecss.io (a minimalist set of css modules) is used, with custom modifications.

Originally created for a short hackathon in less than a day.

Planned features:
- customizing the colors used for display
- counting down in milliseconds if requested
- maybe fetching life expectancy data automatically based on birthdate, country, and gender
